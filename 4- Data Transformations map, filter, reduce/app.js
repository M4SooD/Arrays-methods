// + In JS there are 3 big and important array methods that we use all the time to perform data transformation.
// + These are methods that we use to create new arrays based on transforming data from other arrays.

// #Map Method: another method that we can use to loop over arrays.
// + Map is simillar to forEach method with the differance that map creates a brand new array based on the original.
/* + Map method takes an array, loops over that array, and in each iteration, it applies a 
callback function that we specify in our code to the current array element. */
// + Map returns a new array containing the results of applying an operation on all original array elements

// #Filter Method: Used to filter elements in the original array which satisfy a certain condition.
// + Filter returns a new array containing the array elements that passed a specified test condition.
// + All other elements will get filtered out, so they will not be included in the new array.

// #Reduce Method: We use it to boil down all elements of the original array into one single value.
// + There is no new array in this case, but only the reduced value.
